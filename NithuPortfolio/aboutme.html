                <p>Hello! I'm Nithu Lakshmi, a passionate QA Engineer with two years of experience in software quality assurance, specializing in both Manual and Automation Testing. My journey in the tech industry has been driven by a commitment to delivering high-quality software solutions and ensuring user satisfaction. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Applied Electronics and Instrumentation from Rajagiri School of Engineering & Technology. My ability to quickly adapt to new technologies and methodologies has allowed me to thrive in fast-paced environments and continuously improve my expertise.</p>
                <p>I began my career at Aspire Systems (India) Pvt. Ltd., where I contributed to a significant project, WideOrbit Traffic. During my time there, I was responsible for designing detailed test cases, maintaining comprehensive test documentation, and executing various testing methodologies, including Smoke Testing, Regression Testing, Adhoc Testing, and Exploratory Testing. I worked closely with cross-functional teams to ensure the successful release of the project, effectively communicating test results and metrics to clients. I am skilled in using tools such as Selenium, TestNG, and Maven to deliver top-notch software quality.</p>
                <p>Outside of work, I am dedicated to continuous learning and often explore new technologies related to my field to enhance my skills and stay updated with industry trends. I am continually seeking opportunities for professional growth and development in software quality assurance, and I am eager to contribute to impactful projects that drive innovation and enhance user experiences.</p>
